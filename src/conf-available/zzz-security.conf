# Disable access to the entire file system except for the directories that

#
# This currently breaks the configurations that come with some web application
# Debian packages.

#
# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minimal | Minor | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
ServerTokens Prod

#
# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
ServerSignature Off

#
# Allow TRACE method
#
# Set to "extended" to also reflect the request body (only for testing and
# diagnostic purposes).

#
# Forbid access to version control directories
#
# If you use version control systems in your document root, you should
# probably deny access to their directories. For example, for subversion:
#
<DirectoryMatch "/\.git">
   Require all denied
</DirectoryMatch>

#
# Forbid access to log files
#
<FilesMatch "\.log$">
  Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

#
# Block access to other files that can expose sensitive information.
#
<FilesMatch "(^#.*#|\.(bak|conf|in[ci]|sh|sql)|~)$">
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
